Imporoved version of Sunfounder's Quadruped Crawling Robot.

After building the Crawling Robot I have made a few upgrades:

The robot can now be controlled via Bluetooth. In order for this to work properly it was necessary to use a small Power Distribution Board.

An Android App is available to control the robot.
